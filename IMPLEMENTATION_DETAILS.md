# Implementation Details

WordIndexer utilizes:
- **Multi-threading**: Parallel data processing for high performance.
- **HTML Parsing**: Extracts text content from web pages.
- **Word Normalization**: Groups word forms (e.g., "run", "running").
- **Visualization**: Outputs diagrams using libraries like System.Drawing or OxyPlot.
All processes are optimized for speed and scalability in .NET environments.
